# Electronics-E-Commerce-Application
Brief Summary of the Java Project:

This project is a console-based E-commerce Application for purchasing Electronic Appliances. It simulates a user-friendly car purchasing process, featuring user authentication, product browsing, cart management, and order placement. Here's a breakdown of the key functionalities:

User Management:

Users can log in with their credentials. The application verifies the username and password to ensure secure access. Product Management:

A list of predefined cars is displayed to users with details such as name and price. Products include popular car models like Washing Machine, Television, Iphone 16 pro Max, Refrigerator, and Oven. Cart Management:

Users can add cars to their cart by entering the product ID and desired quantity. Users can also remove the last item from the cart if needed. The application continuously updates the cart as users add or remove items. Order Placement:

Users are given the option to place an order after managing their cart. The total cost of all items in the cart is calculated. A unique Sales Order ID is generated for each order. Details of the order, including the user's ID, product information, quantity, and total cost, are saved. Order Tracking:

Order details are stored in a SalesOrder and SalesOrderDetail structure, ensuring accurate tracking of user purchases. Tech Stack:

Programming Language: Java Data Structures: Lists (ArrayList) for managing users, products, carts, and orders. Core Java Concepts: OOP principles (classes and objects), exception handling, and basic I/O operations (via Scanner). This project provides a practical implementation of object-oriented programming and demonstrates a basic end-to-end process for an e-commerce system. It is an excellent showcase of Java programming skills and understanding of software development principles.
